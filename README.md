# Abstract

This repo contains an Unity game project (and all used assets) that illustrates learning skill stacks through Jenga towers. It is a gamified representation of school subject progression, where mastered skills are represented by stone clocks, learned skills are wood blocks and unkwonw subjects are glass blocks. The game also has a **"Test My Stack"** mode, where the glass blocks are removed and the jenga tower suffers the effect of the physics of the blocks, topping over if not well structured. Note that stone blocks are heavier than wood blocks. The game extracts data from [this API](https://ga1vqcu3o1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Assessment/stack) to buld the 3 towers over a table. Check the image below for an illustration of the core part of the project.
